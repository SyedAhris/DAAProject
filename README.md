# Knapsack Problem Project

<h2>Introduction</h2>

For my class in Design Analysis and Algorithms we were given a project to choose a problem and solve and compare the algorithms on their correctness and running time.
The codes are about solving the knapsack problem using a greedy approach and a dynamic programming approach.

<h2>Files</h2>

  1. testDataCreation.py - this code creates 22 datasets using random numbers.
  2. simpleRecursion.py - a brute force approach to solving knapsack problem.
  3. dynamicProgramming.py - dynamic programming approach to solving the knapsack problem.
  4. greedyAlgorithm - greedy approach to solving the knapsack problem.
  5. runningAlgos.py - this file runs the dynamic programming and greedy approaches on test data.
  6. output.csv - contains the result created by runningAlgos.py.
  7. data01.csv to data22.csv - these are the datasets created by testDataCreation.py.

<h2>Results</h2>

As we can see time taken by greedy is very less as compared to dynamic programming approach.

But on correctness greedy lacks, and using dynamic programming we are having an optimal solution.
